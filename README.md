# Lichenveil
In the shadowed corners of the world lies Lichenveil, a forgotten land where ancient magic and untold creatures hide within dense bogs, shadowy marshes, and sprawling meadows. Players take on the role of adventurers, explorers, and outcasts who forge their own fate by seeking lost treasures, battling mythical beasts, and uncovering the secrets of a land steeped in mystery. Will you thrive in the murk, or will Lichenveil consume you?
